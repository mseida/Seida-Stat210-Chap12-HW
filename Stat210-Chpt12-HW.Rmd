This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

Each variable must have its own column.
Each observation must have its own row.
Each value must have its own cell.

Put each dataset in a tibble.
Put each variable in a column.

All packages in the tidyverse are designed to work with tidy data.

12.2.1

Variables are organized in columns, observations in rows, values in cells.

```{r}
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b
```
The type of table that would be easiest to extra data of TB cases per year compared to populations would be country, year, cases, and population. Then you could do for the whole table instead of reorganizing or going row by row.

12.3
A reason data wouldn't be tidy is because sometimes data entry is made as easy as possible--this doesn't always go along w easy analysis.

One variable might be spread across multiple columns. To fix: gather()
One observation might be scattered across multiple rows. To fix: spread()

Gather() makes wide tables narrower and longer. 
Spread() makes long tables shorter and wider.

Gather and spread are not perfectly symmetrical bc the system does not always know which are variable names and can make vectors and lose data. 

The code fails bc the years are non-syntactic variable names meaning they are numbers w no letters. To fix, insert backmarks. 

We would gather() the pregnant data by using sex("female", "male"), pregnant("yes","no") and count to count the number of responses 

12.4
Separate() pulls apart one column into multiple columns, by splitting wherever a separator character appears. 

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
#table3 %>% 
  #separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
#another way to do same thing ^
```
Unite() is the inverse of separate(): it combines multiple columns into a single column.

```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
```
The **extra argument** tells separate() what to do if there are too many pieces, and the **fill argument** tells it what to do if there arenâ€™t enough.

The **remove argument** gets rid of input columns in the result data. Set it to FALSE if you want to create a new variable, but keep the old one.

12.5
A value can be missing in one of two possible ways:
Explicitly, i.e. flagged with NA.
Implicitly, i.e. simply not present in the data.

An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence.

complete() takes a set of columns, and finds all unique combinations

You can fill in these missing values with fill()

```{r}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)

treatment %>% 
  fill(person)
```
spread() replaces NA with defined variable (set). complete() does same thing but with variety of variables, not just one.


Fill's direction argument determines if NA should be replaced by the variable above or below it.
